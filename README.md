# Machine Learning Project 
Text classification with 20newsgroups Dataset. I think i'll implement scratch/libs some algorithms ML & DL to clustering & classification.
* TF-IDF & Word Embedding to Processing Text Data.
* K-Means to Clustering.
* Logistics, Softmax, SVM to Classifying with Scikit-Learn.
* MLPs with Keras.
* RNN, LSTM & Transformer with Keras.
