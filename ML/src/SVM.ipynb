    "sentence = \"Was foolishly overthought about watching it at cinemas, due to criticism, but the movie was actually a welcomed change to the previous marvel phase setup, it was not boring at any point for the duration of the movie and it was interesting to see how easily things can go really bad that even Thanos Crusade that was the big deal can seem so simple and trivial.Some comments that i noticed complained about 'not enough multiverse etc etc' the movie was not called Doctor Strange visits any other universe :) the movie played with multiverse and showed some different ways that interacting with one another can have a number of unpredictable results .If someone wants a more deep dive into the theme i suggest to watch Loki series, there its explained and shown in a slower pace with more detailOverall a Solid entry for the Genre, and honestly most of the negative comments and chatter can be applied for the most marvel movies out there if taken serious!\"\n",
