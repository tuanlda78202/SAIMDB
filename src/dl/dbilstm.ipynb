            "Texts:  [b'Time for a rant, eh: I thought Spirit was a great movie to watch. However, there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 (I\\'m being a little bit generous with the 7).<br /><br />Point #1: Matt Damon aggravates me. I was thinking, \\'what a dicky voice they got for the main character,\\' when I first heard him narrate - and then I realized it is Matt Damon. The man bugs me so very bad - his performance in \"The Departed\" was terrible and ruined the movie for me (before the movie got a chance to ruin itself, but that\\'s another story for some other time), as it almost did \"Spirit\". I was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was... thankfully.<br /><br />Point #2: Brian Adams sucks... The whole score was terrible... The songs were unoriginal, generic, and poorly executed; not once did I find the music to fit; and the lyrics were terrible. Every time one of the lame songs came on, I was turned off. I almost thought I\\'d start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super-American freedom style lyrics (I couldn\\'t help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9/11). In light of the native American aspects of the film, they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments, not petty radio-hit, teen-bop, 14-year-old-girl crap. I thought I was back in junior high school. I can\\'t believe no better could have been done--I refuse to. Had it not have been for this, I\\'d rank the film up more with Disney, which knows a thing or two about originality (ok, don\\'t bother saying what I know some of you are probably thinking ;). Too bad, it\\'s a shame they couldn\\'t have hired better musicians.<br /><br />I liked the art and animation, except for some things here and there... like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body (thick/dark lines mainly near the end). There were often times when I thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion. But there were also times when the emotion ran thick. Anyhow, many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent.<br /><br />OK, I\\'m falling asleep here so I\\'ll sum it up before I start making less sense...<br /><br />Nice try on an epic film... it turned out mediocre though. Matt Damon, you suck!'\n",
            " b'When I go out to the video store to rent a flick I usually trust IMDb\\'s views on a film and, until this one, had never seen a flick rated 7.0 or above on the site I did not enjoy.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet, a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can: filling a film\\'s cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br /><br />I like films with flawed characters, but no matter how dark someone\\'s personality is we all have a bit of light in there too, we\\'re all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch-black characters.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke\\'s Hank is a 30-something whining, immature, irresponsible man-child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he\\'s a loser, which he very much is. His indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he\\'s too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed. By the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film, it\\'s more pathetic than uplifting. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but isn\\'t given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesn\\'t\\' particularly care that it\\'s there.<br /><br />Speaking of which his character\\'s wife is equally as bad. Just about every single shot of the film she\\'s in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non-existent self-esteem with insults. Seriously, that\\'s just about all the character does. Her harpy-like behavior borders on malevolent.<br /><br />Albert Finney plays their father Charles, and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90% of this film with the same mouth open half-grimace on his face like he\\'s suffering from the world\\'s worst bout of constipation. For someone who\\'s been an actor as long as Mr. Finney, you think he\\'d be more apt at emoting. Even though he doesn\\'t show it much, his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger-filled. And when he smothers Andy at the film\\'s conclusion it\\'s akin to Dr. Frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it\\'s own misery.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei isn\\'t given much to do with her character. Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason. When Andy\\'s world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship, but it really doesn\\'t make her any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film, but probably the one with the most common sense at least.<br /><br />And finally we come to Andy, played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the only reason I rated this film a 3 instead of a 1. His performance of the heroin-addicted, embezzling financial executive who\\'s \"perfect crime\" of robbing his parent\\'s insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing. His descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable, deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic. Hoffman\\'s character ends up being the film\\'s chief villain, but it\\'s hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who\\'s self-admitted poor early parenting led to his son\\'s eventual psychosis and indirect, unintentional murder of his mother.<br /><br />Ultimately this film is really only worth watching for PSH\\'s great performance and it\\'s family train wreck nature. Just don\\'t expect there to be any characters worth cheering for, because there really aren\\'t.'\n",
            " b\"In the ten years since Wildside aired, nothing has really come close to its quality in local production. This includes the two series of the enjoyable but overrated Underbelly, which have brought to life events in the recent criminal history of both Sydney and Melbourne. The miniseries Blue Murder (which also starred Tony Martin, but as someone on the other side of the law) may be the exception.<br /><br />Wildside is currently being repeated late at night on the ABC. Having not watched the show in quite a while, I'm still impressed by its uncompromising story lines and very human characters. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son, Rachael Blake (who later hooked up with Martin in real life) as a community worker struggling with alcoholism, and Alex Dimitriades as a young cop whose vice is gambling. Equally good support roles are provided by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie herself), and a young Abbie Cornish.<br /><br />The ABC inexplicably released only the first three episodes on DVD a couple of years ago. The logic of this sort of marketing is beyond me, but I'm guessing it may have something to do with licensing disagreements with the original producers.<br /><br />A great series which has aged remarkably well. Here's hoping the ABC's DVD department gets its act together.<br /><br />(According to a moderator on an ABC message board, some sort of further DVD release is due in December 2009)\"]\n",

            "Original:  b'When I go out to the video store to rent a flick I usually trust IMDb\\'s views on a film and, until this one, had never seen a flick rated 7.0 or above on the site I did not enjoy.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet, a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can: filling a film\\'s cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br /><br />I like films with flawed characters, but no matter how dark someone\\'s personality is we all have a bit of light in there too, we\\'re all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch-black characters.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke\\'s Hank is a 30-something whining, immature, irresponsible man-child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he\\'s a loser, which he very much is. His indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he\\'s too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed. By the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film, it\\'s more pathetic than uplifting. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but isn\\'t given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesn\\'t\\' particularly care that it\\'s there.<br /><br />Speaking of which his character\\'s wife is equally as bad. Just about every single shot of the film she\\'s in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non-existent self-esteem with insults. Seriously, that\\'s just about all the character does. Her harpy-like behavior borders on malevolent.<br /><br />Albert Finney plays their father Charles, and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90% of this film with the same mouth open half-grimace on his face like he\\'s suffering from the world\\'s worst bout of constipation. For someone who\\'s been an actor as long as Mr. Finney, you think he\\'d be more apt at emoting. Even though he doesn\\'t show it much, his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger-filled. And when he smothers Andy at the film\\'s conclusion it\\'s akin to Dr. Frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it\\'s own misery.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei isn\\'t given much to do with her character. Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason. When Andy\\'s world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship, but it really doesn\\'t make her any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film, but probably the one with the most common sense at least.<br /><br />And finally we come to Andy, played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the only reason I rated this film a 3 instead of a 1. His performance of the heroin-addicted, embezzling financial executive who\\'s \"perfect crime\" of robbing his parent\\'s insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing. His descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable, deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic. Hoffman\\'s character ends up being the film\\'s chief villain, but it\\'s hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who\\'s self-admitted poor early parenting led to his son\\'s eventual psychosis and indirect, unintentional murder of his mother.<br /><br />Ultimately this film is really only worth watching for PSH\\'s great performance and it\\'s family train wreck nature. Just don\\'t expect there to be any characters worth cheering for, because there really aren\\'t.'\n",
