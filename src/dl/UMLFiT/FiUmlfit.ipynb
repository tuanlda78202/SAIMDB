For instance, in the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached in the unsup folder. We can use all of these reviews to fine tune the pretrained language model — this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review.
